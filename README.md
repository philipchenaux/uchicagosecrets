# uchicagosecrets
uchicagosecrets was a submission for the UChicago Hackathon which involved webscraping from facebook and natural language processing. Initially posts from the UChicago facebook page was webscraped and sentiment analysis was performed on each post to yield a seasonal chart showing student sentiment. This was then extended across the facebook pages of other colleges.
